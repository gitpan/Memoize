Calling syntax is now

	memoize(function, OPTION1 => VALUE1, ...) 

instead of

	memoize(function, { OPTION1 => VALUE1, ... }) 


Functions that return lists can now be memoized.

New tests for list-returning functions and their normalizers.

Various documentation changes.

Return value from `unmemoize' is now the resulting unmemoized
function, instead of the constant `1'.  It was already docmuented to
do so.
